Kavas found something incredible. I always thought those ghost sites would cost us more ships than they were worth, the sentries are terrifying, but an Omega blueprint? That's worth at least 100 hacking ships. I almost killed him when he told me he took an exit through Tama to bring it to market, but a K-space connection three jumps from Jita is hard to ignore. Still, all it would have taken is one smartbomb and our dreams would have died as soon as they began.

But he made it. And we made out with four and a half billion isk. I'm still shocked it sold, it's hard to price an item when only a few sell each month across all of New Eden.
