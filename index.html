	Kavas found something incredible. I always thought those ghost sites would cost us more ships than they were worth, the sentries are terrifying, but an Omega blueprint? That's worth at least 100 hacking ships. I almost killed him when he told me he took an exit through Tama to bring it to market, but a K-space connection three jumps from Jita is hard to ignore. Still, all it would have taken is one smartbomb and our dreams would have died as soon as they began. But he made it. And we made out with four and a half <i>billion</i> isk.

	Now we have to send Kavas back into Anoikis, but this time we're not robbing relic sites, we're looking for a new home. I've been training for months to fly an Orca and now we finally have the cash to buy one. Se thinks we're crazy to put almost all of our money into a single ship, one that's valuable enough to attract the attention of the best hunters in the galaxy, but how could an accountant understand? The Orca brings freedom. Not just freedom from the boots of Caldari hegemony, but freedom to create something new.

	You stay out in Anoikis long enough and weird things start happening. Today I connected to the same system twice from two different wormholes. By the time I found the system the second time, my first connection had already vanished. Gave myself a heart attack when my map said there were two different directions heading back toward the system we were hiding out in.
</p>

<p>
	I've been scouring Anoikis for three days straight, must've scanned down 100 systems by now. I still haven't found the right one for our new homestead. There have been plenty of systems with the right connections, but they've all been occupied. It's encouraging to see other small groups making a living in starbases out here but I had no idea how crowded it was. It might take weeks to find the right place. For now, we're resting in a quiet system with only one static connection to low security empire space. We've got a new pilot that wants to fly battleships but has no real experience doing it, so we're going to fit him out in a Praxis and see what he can do. Apparently you can make good money in systems like this by raiding anomaly sites. And with only one static connection, we should be able to watch over all of the wormholes in the system to spot anyone trying to get the drop on us. I just hope the new guy can survive the Sleepers.

	Xanar is going to kill me for this one. I thought it was the opportunity of a lifetime, someone else brought a Praxis into the system we were hiding in! I couldn't let him steal all of our sites, and I couldn't pass on the opportunity to get my first real kill. Sure we've tackled plenty of cheap hacking ships, even caught a Porpoise, but this was a real battleship. In Anoikis you find safety by earning respect, and the best way to do that is to win fights.

	Last night was the first time I saw him on D-scan. Our system was one jump away from a low-class system with a k-space connection a few jumps from Jita. I watched him jump from K-space into the middle system and right into our temporary home! Once inside he started running the anomalies. Because we didn't deploy our starbase in this temporary system, there was no evidence we had been living here, so he probably felt very safe running the sites. I tracked him down and was setting up to jump on him when, like an absolute rookie, I got decloaked by an abandoned structure. I mean come on! The first thing they teach you in flight school is not to warp directly to planets. The Praxis pilot noticed me on D-scan, warped to a safe spot and vanished. I thought that was it, the hunt was over and I blew my chance.

<p>
	Imagine my surprise when today I noticed the same pilot back in system running the same sites. I had been given another chance, and this time, I wouldn't spoil it by revealing myself too soon. I warped to the site he was running, crept up on him, decloaked and locked him. What a rush! What I didn't anticipate was that I would have no idea what to do when I caught him. He immediately turned his guns from the Sleepers to me and started brawling. I thought I'd be able to take him in a fair fight but that proved to be completely wrong. Sevro tried to back me up in his Curse but by the time he got there it was already over. Thank the Gods he was at least able to get out unscathed. Worst of all, I wasn't even locked down, nothing was keeping me from warping off to safety, I just waited too long to initiate the warp. Now we're out half a billion isk and I've done irreperable damage to our reputation. Imagine what people will think when they stumble upon our future starbase, look us up and see that I lost a Loki to a Praxis on a sleeper site! We'll look like low-hanging fruit, ripe for the picking. I'll fix this, I have to, one day we'll be a group worthy of respect, maybe even fear.
