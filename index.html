<h1>Jan. 15, YC 127</h1>

	Kavas found something incredible. I always thought those ghost sites would cost us more ships than they were worth, the sentries are terrifying, but an Omega blueprint? That's worth at least 100 hacking ships. I almost killed him when he told me he took an exit through Tama to bring it to market, but a K-space connection three jumps from Jita is hard to ignore. Still, all it would have taken is one smartbomb and our dreams would have died as soon as they began. But he made it. And we made out with four and a half <i>billion</i> isk.

	Now we have to send Kavas back into Anoikis, but this time we're not robbing relic sites, we're looking for a new home. I've been training for months to fly an Orca and now we finally have the cash to buy one. Se thinks we're crazy to put almost all of our money into a single ship, one that's valuable enough to attract the attention of the best hunters in the galaxy, but how could an accountant understand? The Orca brings freedom. Not just freedom from the boots of Caldari hegemony, but freedom to create something new.
